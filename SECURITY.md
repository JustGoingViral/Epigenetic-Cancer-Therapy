# Security Policy

## HIPAA Compliance & Healthcare Data Security

This repository implements a healthcare platform that must comply with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and other healthcare data protection regulations.

## üîí Security Standards

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All PHI (Protected Health Information) encrypted using AES-256
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all data transmission
- **Database Security**: Row-level security with encrypted columns for sensitive data
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS/Azure Key Vault for encryption key management

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Required for all user accounts
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Principle of least privilege
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout
- **API Security**: JWT tokens with short expiration times

### HIPAA Compliance Requirements
- **Access Logs**: Comprehensive audit trails for all PHI access
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and process necessary health information
- **User Training**: Security awareness documentation and procedures
- **Business Associate Agreements**: Required for all third-party integrations
- **Data Breach Response**: Incident response plan and notification procedures

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for Python security scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety for known vulnerabilities
- **Secrets Detection**: GitLeaks for credential scanning
- **Code Review**: Mandatory security review for all changes

### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Docker image scanning with Trivy
- **Network Security**: VPC isolation and security groups
- **Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with access controls

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and output encoding
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF prevention

## üìä Vulnerability Management

### Regular Security Assessments
- **Weekly**: Automated dependency vulnerability scans
- **Monthly**: Code security analysis
- **Quarterly**: Penetration testing
- **Annually**: Comprehensive security audit

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: security@[domain].com (replace with actual security contact)
2. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports
3. **Response Time**: We commit to acknowledging reports within 24 hours

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy
- We will investigate all legitimate security reports
- We will provide regular updates on remediation progress
- We will publicly acknowledge responsible disclosure (with permission)
